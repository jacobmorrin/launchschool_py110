"""
PROBLEM:
Write a function that takes a string as an argument, and returns 
a list that contains every word from the string, with each word
followed by a space and the word's length. 

RULES:
- If the argument is an empty string, return an empty list
- Punctuation is included as aprt of the strings
- Words are separated by spaces

EXAMPLES:
# All of these examples should print True
words = 'cow sheep chicken'
expected_result = ['cow 3', 'sheep 5', 'chicken 7']
print(word_lengths(words) == expected_result)        # True

words = 'baseball hot dogs and apple pie'
expected_result = ['baseball 8', 'hot 3', 'dogs 4',
                   'and 3', 'apple 5', 'pie 3']
print(word_lengths(words) == expected_result)        # True

words = "It ain't easy, is it?"
expected_result = ['It 2', "ain't 5", 'easy, 5',
                   'is 2', 'it? 3']
print(word_lengths(words) == expected_result)        # True

big_word = 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'
print(word_lengths(big_word) == [f'{big_word} 34'])  # True

print(word_lengths('') == [])                        # True
print(word_lengths() == [])                          # True

DATA:
- Input: String
- Output: List of strings [{word} {word_length}]

ALGORITHM:
Option 1:
- Create empty list
- Create list of words using split
- Loop through list of words
- Store word and word length in variable(s)
- Append to list

Option 2:
- List comprehension
